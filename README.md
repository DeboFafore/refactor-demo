# Project Title

This project is a demonstration of a website refactor which improved accessibility features and code readability. This was accomplished by:

* Adapting non-descriptive div elements into semantic HTML elements (e.g. section);
* Creating alt text for all site images;
* Consolidating pre-existing CSS code into robust general purpose classes; and
* Restructuring CSS code to reflect site layout;

### Prerequisites

Other than a web brower no software installation is needed.
